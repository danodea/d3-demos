# D3 demos

D3.js demos with (hopefully) helpful comments.  Let me know if you have any questions or suggetstions for improvement!

#### bar-chart-demos
The bar-chart-demos folder contains bar chart demos from [Mike Bostock's Let's Make A Bar Chart Tutorials](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/).  I've updated the demos to Version 4 of D3.js, and added a jQuery example.  I highly recommend reading through the tutorials even though they use verion 3.

#### mls-demo
A demo of a colorful bubble chart (*index.html*) of soccer jersey numbers created from some Major League Soccer data I scraped (*jersey-numbers.json*, extracted from *data.json* using *get-numbers.js*).  Each bubble is sized according the number of players in the league that have that jersey number.
